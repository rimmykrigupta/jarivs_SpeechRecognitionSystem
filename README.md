# jarivs_SpeechRecognitionSystem
The Jarvis virtual assistant project is structured to run from a main file that initializes with the message "Initializing Jarvis." Once active, it listens for the keyword "Jarvis." Upon recognition, it responds with "I can listen to you," indicating its readiness to accept commands. Users can then assign tasks to Jarvis, such as playing a specific song or retrieving the latest news headlines. The assistant integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech functionality, and AI processing to deliver a seamless and interactive experience.
